# Lake Wobegon Hiring Strategy

Google’s hiring strategy is said to be the Lake Wobegon Strategy, which says only hire candidates who have scores above your current employees’ mean. It is also termed as ‘above the mean’ strategy. 

Another hiring strategy is to hire candidates who have scores higher than the minimum of your current employees. This strategy is termed as ‘above
the minimum’ strategy.

Assuming two start-ups Company A and Company B, have 15 employees each with a mean score of 70 and a minimum score of 60 (max
score is 100). 

Company A uses ‘above the mean’ hiring, and Company B uses ”above the minimum” hiring.
