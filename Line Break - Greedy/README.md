# Line Break - Greedy Approach

Given a word-sequence and line-width, i.e., max. number of characters that can be put in a line.
Develop a greedy solution to put line-breaks in the given sequence in a way to have balanced lines. 
Assume that the length of each word is smaller than the line-width.

Trace out the solution for the following two examples using your solution and state the cost in terms of the time complexity.

```
Word-sequence: ‘aaa bb cc ddddd’
Line-width: 6
```

```
Word-sequence: ‘This is known as the word wrap problem’
Line-width: 10
```
