# Travelling Salesman Problem - Hamiltonian Cycle

A traveling salesman has to cover a set of 5 cities (his own included) periodically (say, once per week) and return home. 
The distances between the cities are given in Table 2, as could have been read on a map.

Find the minimum weight Hamiltonian cycle.

Cost matrix (distances in km) from one city to another

```
City    A       B       C       D       E
A       0       132     217     164     58
B       132     0       290     201     79
C       217     290     0       113     303
D       164     201     113     0       196
E       58      79      303     196     0
