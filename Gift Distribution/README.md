# Gift Distribution

Suppose there are N gifts. The color of each gift is represented as a lowercase letter. We want to distribute N gifts to M people. They will be upset if they get two gifts of the same color. We can give any number of gifts to people, and they wonâ€™t be upset even if they do not get any gift, but we have to distribute all gifts, such that no one will be upset.
