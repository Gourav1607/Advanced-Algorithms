# Village Road Min Cost - MST

Due to the worsening flood situation in some north-eastern state in India, every single road connecting different villages in a district damaged completely. 
So the district administration decided to rebuild the roads and establish a connection between every village again that too with minimum cost. 
So calculate the minimum cost to reconnect all villages by rebuilding the roads. 

There are N number of villages in total. Input is in the form of two-dimensional array buildcost[N][N], where buildcost[i][j] represent the cost to rebuild road between village i and j (0 in the case when there is no road between the villages).
